Stateful functions are the building blocks of applications; they are atomic units of isolation, distribution, and persistence.
As objects, they encapsulate the state of a single entity (e.g., a specific user, device, or session) and encode its behavior.
Stateful functions can interact with each other, and external systems, through message passing.
The GoLang SDK is supported as a [remote module]({{ site.baseurl}}/sdk/index.html#remote-module).
